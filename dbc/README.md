## Generate Headers From DBC

Use Kvaser Database Editor 3, and make the required changes to your CAN fields.

Save the .dbc in a known location.

Run **coderdbc-gui.exe**, and select your saved .dbc file. You will be prompted to select an output folder.

In this case, the files are used from a folder named **candef** under /src.

You can then access the generated variables in your code.
